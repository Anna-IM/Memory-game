# Memory Game 

This is a fun game which can test your memory. 

## Instructions

1. Download the game from here - https://github.com/Anna-Ilieva/Memory-game
2. Open the file index.html and you will see the game appearing in the browser
3. After the first click on a random card the game starts

**Playing is simple** - you need to click on one card and try to find the matching card to this one. 
Above the card deck, you can see the time you are playing, how many stars you have and how many moves you've done during the game. 
The restart button is on the right side of the screen and it will help you to play again after clicking on it. 
Once the game is finished, there will be a message saying you:
- how many stars you have
- how much time you've played
- how to play again

Just try to match the cards properly with less moves and as fast as you can!

### How I created the game

The game is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (with JQuery library). 
- Shuffle function from http://stackoverflow.com/a/2450976
- Counter to count the moves of the player
- Timer 
- Function that checks if the open cards match and if the cards match they stay open
- Restart button
- Pop-up modal box after the game is finished
- CSS animation after a pair of cards match
